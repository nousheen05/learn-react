How to create a react app?
A: use "npx create-react-app my-app" command, it creates a react app(folder with name my-app and contains boiler plate).
To start on local host. We use command - "npm start" inside that my-app


#creating our first react component
1) As our starting file is index.js, we will start from there


# JSX Rules - as we return jsx for a component function
1) We should return a single HTML element
2) The element can be div / article / section or a react fragment
Tip: <React.fragment><React.fragment/> or <></>
3) use camelCase for HTML attributes ex: onClick
4) To define class for a html element use className instead of class
5) formatting - after return statement recommended to use ()
